# Coucou for Windows

**Mochi doesn't get a notch on a PC — so it lives at the top of your screen instead.**

Approve agent permissions, watch your sessions work, drop a file, chat with Claude, keep an eye on your services — without leaving what you're doing. Works with Claude Code, OpenCode and Antigravity.

## Install

1. Download `Coucou-Windows-setup.exe` from the [latest release](releases/tag/windows-latest).
2. Run it. It installs for the current user only — no admin prompt.
3. Coucou starts, waves hello, and then gets out of the way.

### "Windows protected your PC"

The installer isn't code-signed yet, so **SmartScreen** shows a blue warning the first
few times anybody downloads it:

> Windows protected your PC — Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognised app from starting.

Click **More info**, then **Run anyway**. That's it. Signing is on the list; until
then this is what an unsigned installer looks like on Windows, and you can always
[build it yourself](#build-it-yourself) if you'd rather not trust a download.

## Using it

<img src="screenshots/compact.png" width="292" alt="The compact island, with the integration pills as mini Mochis">
<img src="screenshots/overview.png" width="640" alt="The overview: the focused integration on the left, the other pills on the right">
<img src="screenshots/approval.png" width="640" alt="A Claude Code permission request, with Deny and Allow">
<img src="screenshots/chat.png" width="640" alt="Chatting with Claude from the island">
<img src="screenshots/drop.png" width="640" alt="Mochi turned into a box, waiting for a file">

| What you do | What happens |
|---|---|
| Move the mouse to the very top-centre of the screen | Mochi peeks out |
| Click the small island | It opens |
| Click Mochi | It gets annoyed. Three times in a row and it goes dizzy |
| Rest the pointer on Mochi for two seconds | Hearts |
| Drag a file onto the island | Mochi turns into a box, swallows it, then offers to answer questions about it |
| `Esc` | Closes the island |
| Tray icon | Open, Settings…, Pause, Quit |

Everything else happens on its own: a Claude Code permission request opens the
island with **Deny / Allow**, a finished session shows what it did, and
your integrations sit in the coloured pills next to Mochi.

## Claude Code

<img src="screenshots/settings.png" width="562" alt="The settings window">

Open **Settings… → Claude Code → Install hooks…**. You get the exact diff of what
will change in `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json`, the path of the dated backup
that will be taken, and nothing is written until you click. Your own hooks are
never touched, and uninstalling removes only Coucou's entries.

The relay is a tiny executable, `coucou-hook.exe`, copied to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Coucou\bin\` at launch. It is given 300 ms to reach Coucou and
exits cleanly if the app is closed, slow or crashed — **a Claude Code session is
never blocked or slowed down by Coucou.** If nobody answers a permission request
in time, Coucou stays quiet and Claude Code asks in the terminal as usual.

It works from any terminal — Windows Terminal, PowerShell, VS Code, Git Bash.

## OpenCode

Open **Settings… → OpenCode → Install hooks…**. Coucou copies its `coucou.js`
plugin (with your relay path baked in) to
`%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\plugins\`, with the same dated-backup and
diff-preview flow as the Claude Code hooks. Nothing is written until you click.

The plugin forwards session, tool and permission events through
`coucou-hook.exe` to the island, where OpenCode gets its own pill. Approvals
work the same way: Allow / Deny in the island, TUI prompt when Coucou can't
answer. One thing to do yourself: OpenCode only raises permission prompts for
tools your policy marks `ask`, so island approvals need something like

```json
{ "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json", "permission": { "*": "ask" } }
```

in `%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\opencode.json`. Explicit `deny` rules are
still enforced first. For a single project, copy the installed plugin to
`<project>\.opencode\plugins\coucou.js` instead of installing globally.

## Antigravity

Open **Settings… → Antigravity → Install hooks…**. Coucou merges its entries
under the `coucou` key into the global `%USERPROFILE%\.gemini\config\hooks.json`
(`PreToolUse` with a 120 s approval timeout, `PostToolUse`, `PreInvocation`
and `Stop` at 10 s) — dated backup, diff preview, nothing written until you
click. Antigravity gets its own pill in the island; tool calls that need a
human show the same Allow / Deny card, and fall back to Antigravity's own
prompt (respecting your Always Allow grants) when Coucou can't answer.

For a single project, merge the `coucou` key from
[`agents/antigravity-hooks-snippet.json`](agents/antigravity-hooks-snippet.json) into
`<project>\.agents\hooks.json` instead of installing globally.

## Chat and keys

**Settings… → Claude** takes your Anthropic API key. Keys live in the **Windows
Credential Manager**, never on disk and never in the interface — the island can
only ask whether a key exists. Same for every integration key.

No telemetry. The only network requests Coucou makes are to the services you
configure yourself.

## Build it yourself

You need [Rust](https://rustup.rs), [Node 20+](https://nodejs.org), and the
**MSVC build tools** (Visual Studio Build Tools with "Desktop development with
C++"). WebView2 ships with Windows 10/11.

```powershell
npm install
npm run tauri dev      # live-reloading development build
npm run pack           # builds the installer and drops it in release/
```

`npm run dev` alone serves the front end in an ordinary browser, which is enough
to work on the island's looks. It also serves `dev/upload-preview.html`, which
replays the whole file-drop choreography on a loop — the one part of the UI that
otherwise needs a real drag from Explorer to see. Neither page ships in the app.

`npm run pack` leaves two files in `release/`, the same names the release
workflow publishes:

```
Coucou-Windows-X.Y.Z-setup.exe    the versioned installer
Coucou-Windows-setup.exe          the same file under the rolling name
```

Installing is optional — `target/release/coucou.exe` runs on its own. There is no
window in the taskbar and no console: the island at the top of the screen and the
Mochi in the notification area are the whole app, and Quit lives in its menu.

The 28 sounds live in `assets/sounds/`. The path is declared once, in
`SOUNDS_DIR` at the top of `vite.config.ts` — dev serves them from there and
the build copies them into `dist/sounds` for the installer.

The app icon and the tray icon are drawn in code, like Mochi itself:

```powershell
npm run icons          # regenerates src-tauri/icons from scripts/gen-icons.mjs
```

### Layout

```
  src/                 island front end (TypeScript, no framework)

    island/            state machine, hooks, integrations
    views/             every island view
    settings/          the settings window
  src-tauri/           Rust backend: window, named pipe, Claude API, pollers

```

### Log

`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Coucou\coucou.log` — hook events, permission decisions, poller
problems. It stays on your machine.

## Notes

- There is no notch on a PC, so the island lives at the top centre of the
  screen and retracts into the top edge.
- Permission approval works from **any** terminal — Windows Terminal,
  PowerShell, VS Code, Git Bash.
- "Open terminal" opens the working folder in VS Code when `code` is on your
  `PATH`, and falls back to Explorer otherwise.
- Cal.com shows the next bookings as a list.
- Roadmap: sending a file by email, dragging Mochi onto a window to attach it
  as context, and jumping to a specific terminal window.
